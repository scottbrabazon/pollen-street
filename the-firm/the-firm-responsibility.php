					<h1>The Pollen Street Capital ESG policy</h1>
					<p>
					<p><strong>I. Purpose</strong><br /> 
					This document sets out Pollen Street Capital’s (“PSC’s”) approach to the management of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.</p>


					<p><strong>II. Scope</strong><br />
					The ESG Policy covers all PSC funds (PE and Credit), existing portfolio companies as well as new acquisitions, all investment activities and PSC’s own operations. All PSC staff are required to adhere to the ESG Policy.</p>


					<p><strong>III. Our Guiding Principles</strong><br />
					PSC recognises that the industry in which it operates can have a significant impact on society and the environment. The sector reaches a large number of people across many countries and involves the use of a significant amount of the earth’s natural resources.</p>

					<p>PSC believes that ESG issues should be integral to the investment process and has formalised its approach to managing these issues. PSC understands that the effective ownership and management of a company or an investment creates benefits for all stakeholders, for example employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders. Implementing best practice management techniques for ESG issues contributes to both mitigating risks and capturing opportunities that enhance the long-term value of the PSC funds’. PSC is committed to helping its investment funds make responsible investments in order to create sustainable, long-term value in close partnership with management teams.</p>

					<p>[PSC is a signatory of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). It is committed to implementing its Principles with a view to aligning its investment management and advisory activities to the interests of wider stakeholders.]</p>

					<p><strong>IV. Our commitments to invest responsibly</strong><br />
					PSC commits to</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Comprehensive and robust ESG governance.</strong><span> </span>The CEO and the Group Risk Manager are responsible for overseeing PSC’s ESG management activities. The Deal and Operations teams are responsible for implementing the ESG Policy and Procedures, with the support of General Counsel. PSC provides its staff with specific ESG training and resources to help them to fulfil their ESG commitments.</li>

						<li><strong>Ensuring it complies with all ESG-related legislation.</strong><span> </span>PSC has set its own ESG Guidelines and strongly encourages all portfolio companies in the PSC funds to meet them. Where appropriate, PSC expects the portfolio companies to comply with additional voluntary standards, [such as the IFC Performance Standards,] particularly where local legislative standards are weak or laws are poorly enforced. It supports the payment of competitive wages and benefits to employees; providing a safe and healthy workplace in conformance with national and local law.</li>

						<li><strong>No tolerance of irresponsible or corrupt business practices.</strong><span> </span>PSC adopt strict policies that prohibit bribery and other improper payments to public officials consistent with [the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, similar laws in other countries, and the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention].</li>
						<li><strong>Embedding ESG issue management throughout the deal cycle:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Pre-acquisition:</strong>
								PSC assesses ESG risks and management standards when evaluating all investment opportunities. PSC analyses inherent ESG risks and relevant management activities (to the extent that information is available) throughout the PSC investment process. When material ESG issues are identified, they may be included in formal submissions to the Investment Committee, and external advisors may be engaged to carry out additional ESG-related due diligence as needed. Where management of, or performance on, a material issue is considered by PSC to need improvement a corrective action plan will be completed.<br />If PSC concludes that the ESG risks of a target company are too great and cannot be appropriately mitigated, no investment is made.
							</li>
						</ul>

				<div class="the-firm-responsibility-c__body">
					<ul>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Post-closing:</strong>PSC supports portfolio companies in understanding and improving their ESG performance, where necessary. Where there are material issues identified during the diligence process, these issues are included in a short tem action plan post-close. Within the first 12 months of ownership by the PSC funds PSC conducts a detailed review of each company’s ESG management practices. These reviews represent an opportunity for PSC to engage with the portfolio companies and to offer support to help them meet PSC’s ESG Guidelines. In cases where PSC identifies significant need for value protection or potential for value creation, a further, comprehensive review of the portfolio company’s ESG activities, is undertaken, potentially with the assistance of external experts.</li>
							<li><strong>Monitoring and continuous improvement:</strong>
							PSC monitors portfolio companies’ and investments ESG performance with a view to identify and respond to opportunities for further improvement on an ongoing basis. PSC has a process to allow portfolio companies to promptly report any material ESG incidents and remains ready to provide support to portfolio companies should these situations arise. Where management of, or performance on, a material issue is considered by PSC to need improvement, PSC will work with management to support the development of a corrective action plan.</li>
							<li><strong>Exit:</strong>Where relevant, PSC discloses relevant ESG information, gathered through the preacquisition and PSC fund ownership periods, to potential buyers at the exit stage.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Engaging with investors and stakeholders on ESG issues</strong>. PSC includes ESG information in periodic reports to investors, makes the ESG Policy available to investors and responds to ad hoc requests for ESG information from investors. The format of this reporting may vary among written public reports, verbal informal reports, or confidential fund or asset-level reports. PSC will seek to actively engage relevant stakeholders in an effort to make informed decisions that may affect these stakeholders.</li>

					<p><br /><strong>II. Our performance standards ?</strong></p>
					<p>When making an investment decision, the assessment may consider as a guide the International Finance Corporation (IFC) 2012 Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability (Performance Standards) as they apply to the PSC investment process, as well as any additional ESG guidance that PSC has sought and considers to be applicable. <br />Our performance standard</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Identifies and evaluate environmental and social risks and impacts of the investment.</li>
						<li>assesses what can be done to anticipate and avoid, or where avoidance is not possible, minimize, the impact and, where residual impacts remain, compensate/offset for risks and impacts to workers, the local community, and the environment.</li>
						<li>Promotes improved environmental and social performance of portfolio companies and investment partners through the effective use of management systems.</li>
						<li>ensures that grievances from local communities and external communications from others are recorded and actioned </li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>III. How do we govern this policy?</strong></p>
					<p>The ESG Policy is updated annually to reflect ongoing efforts to improve its ESG approach, as well as emerging requirements from stakeholders and evolving good practices.</p>
					<p>PSC will actively communicate the ESG Policy to investment teams and will use the ESG Policy as a basis to engage internal and external stakeholders on ESG management, as appropriate.</p>
					<p>The CEO and Group Risk Manager sponsor this ESG Policy and are accountable to the Boards of PSC Holdings Limited for its implementation. The Board receives regular report on ESG matters</p>
					<p>PSC use governance structures that provide appropriate levels of oversight in the areas of audit, risk management, allocation and potential conflicts of interest. It implements compensation and other policies that align the interests of owners and management.</p>
